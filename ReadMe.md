Ok, This Is Amog OS But Based On Pop!_OS LTS 22.04 And It Will Not Upgrade Pop OS Until August 10th 2033. I Will Try To Update This As Often As Possible But No Promises Will Be Made. This Has Nothing To Do With Amog OS And Is Just A Fan-made Spin Off
On Ubuntu. Hope You Enjoy Among OS LTS!

A parody OS inspired by Among Us à¶ž. (pronounced A-mog O-S L-T-S)

 

General Info
This was mostly inspired The OG Chad Amog OS And It Not Working On My Device. AmogOS LTS is a meme OS based on the hit game Among Us, in the same vein as Hannah Montana Linux, but it's also developed and made to be a lightweight operating system. AmogOS LTS is also less bloated than some other distros (Cough Cough Fedora). Chad AmogOS LTS vs bloated mainstream distro, as youtuber TechHut put it. Don't take this too seriously :p
